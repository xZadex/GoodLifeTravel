# GoodLifeTravel

Hello everyone!

  This is my first project that I am currently using to understand the basics of HTML and CSS. Along with learning how to use github/github pages to host my projects. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

  My initial thought was to start building out portfolio projects. I decided to create a fake company and make a website for the company using only HTML and CSS. After some help from google I had a randomly generated company name and logo. I wanted this company to be in the luxury travel niche so that's what I planned the design around. With the knowledge I have so far I would like to think it didn't come out too bad. If you notice anything that could have been done more efficiently please let me know as I love to learn from my mistakes.
